# Todo-app using React with Type-script

This project is a Todo List application built using React. It allows users to create, manage, and track their tasks. The application provides features such as adding new tasks, marking tasks as completed, filtering tasks based on their status (All, Active, Completed), and clearing completed tasks.  This project demonstrates proficiency in React development, state management with the Context API, and the use of TypeScript for statically-typed code. 

Technologies Used:

React: The project is developed using the React library, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. 

Context API: The Context API is used for state management, allowing data to be passed through the component tree without manually passing props.

CSS: Styles for the application are written using CSS, with separate style sheets for index, todo list, and filters to maintain a well-organized structure.

TypeScript: TypeScript is used for static typing, enhancing the development experience by catching potential errors during development.

The project comprises various components, including Header, Footer, TodoItem, Todos, and the main App component. Each component serves a specific purpose in creating a seamless user experience for managing tasks.
